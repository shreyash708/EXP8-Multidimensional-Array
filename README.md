# Title : 2D Array – Matrices

# Tools : VS Code

# Aim: 

Accepts a matrix of size r × c from the user.

1.Displays the original matrix. 2.Computes and stores the transpose of the matrix. 3.Addition of matrix. 4.Multiplication of matrix. 5.Addition of only diagoal element.

# Theory:
Two for loop is required to Display the matrix, and asking the user to provide the value of rows and columns respectively, i is for rows and j is for columns. For transpose of matrix , new matrix will be like rows will become columns and vice-versa. For Addition of matrix using ' + ' arithmetic operation and for multiplication '*'. For Addition of diagonal elements check the condition if i==j or not if it's equal , then store the sum in another sum variable.

# Conclusion :

Initialisation of multidimensional array ,and how to display it, and performed various operations on matrix, Learned about the concept of nested for loop, index position of array value.
